- Check if something is in an array or string without using a loop, this includes `while`, `for`, `.forEach`, `.map` and `.filter`.

* Hint: There is an array method that may be useful in solving this problem.

## Getting Started

- Fork and Clone
- `npm i`
- `npm run test` or `npm test` and make sure the tests fail.


The objective of this problem is to assess your creativity in solving a restrictive problem. The output should either return true or false depending on the test case.
No loops are allowed, the test's will fail if there is a loop.
