## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Does Include"

### Objectives

- Check if a given parameter (`x`) exists in a given array or string (`data`) **without using a loop**.
- The output should either return `true` or `false` depending on the test case.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!

### Notes

Remember, loops include `while` and `for`, as well as the `.forEach`, `.map` and `.filter` higher-order methods. These are not allowed. The objective of this problem is to assess your creativity and resourcefulness in solving a restrictive problem.
